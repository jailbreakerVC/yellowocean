<h1> YELLOW OCEAN </h1>
This is an app which would give you tasks every day, tasks which will improve your mental health. These tasks are like exercises which help you stay focused and keep your mind clear, reducing stress and anxiety.

Currently you can just go through all the tasks, but the idea is the app would give you one task every day for a set number of days (like a month) and teach you tools to improve your mental health being. 

For now there are only a few tasks added.
